Small platform to quickly make environments with walls, gold, and a simple agent.

Primarily targeted at quick development of environments for RL.
DiscreteEngine2Env has the boilerplate for working with an RL agent; all the levels for it are re-encoded in the director dict\_levels.

This repo is a pygame reimplementation of this JS code: https://github.com/atbolsh/DiscreteSimpleEnv


I will probably add sprites for more advanced functionality in some downstream reimplementation, following this: https://joereynoldsaudio.com/2018/06/12/pygame-practices.html
